Homework One, completed by Jayden Sansom, jksanso2


Summary
The code created for this homework, following the instructions given, is divided into four separate directories. Each contains the files needed to show the product of their respective parts.

Instructions
To begin creating and running the executable after unzipping the file, first navigate to the terminal on the Ubuntu environment. Use ‘cd’ commands to reach the directory where the folder contained within the .zip file was stored and change directories to be within it. 

Initialization:
        -'cd' to the working directory of 'HW1'

For Part 1:
        -Enter the command “cd 'Part 1'” to enter the correct directory.
        -Run the command "make init" to update or install the required course libraries (SFML, etc.)
        -Run the command “make clean” in case any fragments of old executables remain or you are attempting to recreate the program.
        -Run the command “make” and look to ensure that two files were created, “main” and “homework1Part1.o”.
        -To change the permissions to allow you to execute the code, enter the command “chmod a+x main”.
        -Finally, run the command “./main” to start executing the window and see the demonstration of Part 1!
        -If the terminal claims that you do not have permissions, reenter the command “chmod a+x main” and then “./main” to try again. This may have to be repeated several times but will eventually work.

For Part 2:
        -Enter the command “cd 'Part 2'” to enter the correct directory.
        -Run the command "make init" to update or install the required course libraries (SFML, etc.)
        -Run the command “make clean” in case any fragments of old executables remain or you are attempting to recreate the program.
        -Run the command “make” and look to ensure that two files were created, “main” and “homework1Part2.o”.
        -To change the permissions to allow you to execute the code, enter the command “chmod a+x main”.
        -Finally, run the command “./main” to start executing the window and see the demonstration of Part 2!
        -If the terminal claims that you do not have permissions, reenter the command “chmod a+x main” and then “./main” to try again. This may have to be repeated several times but will eventually work.

For Part 3:
        -Enter the command “cd 'Part 3'” to enter the correct directory.
        -Run the command "make init" to update or install the required course libraries (SFML, etc.)
        -Run the command “make clean” in case any fragments of old executables remain or you are attempting to recreate the program.
        -Run the command “make” and look to ensure that two files were created, “main” and “homework1Part3.o”.
        -To change the permissions to allow you to execute the code, enter the command “chmod a+x main”.
        -Finally, run the command “./main” to start executing the window and see the demonstration of Part 3!
                -Press A or Left to move Left
                -Press D or Right to move Right
                -Press Space, W, or Up to jump
        -If the terminal claims that you do not have permissions, reenter the command “chmod a+x main” and then “./main” to try again. This may have to be repeated several times but will eventually work.

For Part 4:
        -Enter the command “cd 'Part 4'” to enter the correct directory.
        -Run the command "make init" to update or install the required course libraries (SFML, etc.)
        -Run the command “make clean” in case any fragments of old executables remain or you are attempting to recreate the program.
        -Run the command “make” and look to ensure that two files were created, “main” and “homework1Part4.o”.
        -To change the permissions to allow you to execute the code, enter the command “chmod a+x main”.
        -Finally, run the command “./main” to start executing the window and see the demonstration of Part 4!
                -Press A or Left to move Left
                -Press D or Right to move Right
                -Press Space, W, or Up to jump
        -If the terminal claims that you do not have permissions, reenter the command “chmod a+x main” and then “./main” to try again. This may have to be repeated several times but will eventually work.
